              Bookshelf API is a RESTful service developed using Node.js and @hapi, designed to empower users in managing their book collections. Throughout its development, I honed essential skills in creating, reading, updating, and

              Lib-Karangturi is a platform for publishing the daily activities and information of the Karangturi Village Library Community. The project was built for the Brawijaya University Mahasiswa Mengabdi Desa program. Collaborating
              with my teammate, I leveraged HTML, CSS, PHP, Laravel Frameworks, and Bootstrap 5. In a short period of two weeks, while concurrently participating in other social voluntary works for the village, I designed, developed, and
              implemented the website independently. The platform empowered the community by facilitating efficient information sharing, thereby enhancing public awareness of the village library's valuable resources.
